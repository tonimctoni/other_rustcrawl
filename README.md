# Another crawler in rust

My other crawler written in rust was aweful. While I am still learning, this one is already looking a lot better.


## Usage
Set configuration in `config.json` and run.

## Understanding it
There are no comments, but there is a nice chart showing between which entities the data flows, in what direction, and how. The main function just starts all entities.
